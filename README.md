The first step to optimising your webpack build speed, is to know where to focus your attention.

This plugin measures your webpack build speed, giving an output like this:

## Install

```bash
npm install --save speed-measure-webpack-plugin
```

or

```bash
yarn add speed-measure-webpack-plugin
```

## Usage

Change your webpack config from

```javascript
const webpackConfig = {
  plugins: [
    new MyPlugin(),
    new MyOtherPlugin()
  ]
}
```

to

```javascript
const SpeedMeasurePlugin = require("speed-measure-webpack-plugin");

const smp = new SpeedMeasurePlugin();

const webpackConfig = smp.wrap({
  plugins: [
    new MyPlugin(),
    new MyOtherPlugin()
  ]
});
```

and you're done! SMP will now be printing timing output to the console by default

## Options

Options are (optionally) passed in to the constructor

```javascript
const smp = new SpeedMeasurePlugin(options);
```

### `options.outputFormat`

Type: `String|Function`<br>
Default: `"human"`

Determines in what format this plugin prints its measurements

 * `"json"` - produces a JSON blob
 * `"human"` - produces a human readable output
 * `"humanVerbose"` - produces a more verbose version of the human readable output
 * If a function, it will call the function with the JSON blob being the first parameter, and just the response of the function as the output

### `options.outputTarget`

Type: `String|Function`<br>
Default: `console.log`

* If a string, it specifies the path to a file to output to.
* If a function, it will call the function with the output as the first parameter

### `options.disable`

Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

If truthy, this plugin does nothing at all. It is recommended to set this with something similar to `{ disable: !process.env.MEASURE }` to allow opt-in measurements with a `MEASURE=true npm run build`

### `options.granularLoaderData` _(experimental)_

Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

If truthy, this plugin will attempt to break down the loader timing data to give per-loader timing information.

Points of note that the following loaders will have inaccurate results in this mode:

 * loaders using separate processes (e.g. `thread-loader`) - these make it difficult to get timing information on the subsequent loaders, as they're not attached to the main thread
 * loaders emitting file output (e.g. `file-loader`) - the time taken in outputting the actual file is not included in the running time of the loader

These are restrictions from technical limitations - ideally we would find solutions to these problems before removing the _(experimental)_ flag on this options
